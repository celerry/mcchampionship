# mcchampionship

MCC [API v1](https://api.mcchampionship.com/docs#/v1) wrapper. Built with [Bun](https://bun.sh).

Not tested on Node.js, but it should work (as long as you're running node.js v18+). Feel free to open an issue/PR if it doesn't. :~)

## Development

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh)
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```

To run tests:
```bash
bun test
```

## Acknowledgement

I'm aware that an OpenAPI spec exists for the MCC API, but I'm not using it to generate this library because I enjoy pain.
